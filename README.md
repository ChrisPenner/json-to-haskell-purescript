# react-basic-starter (Spacchetti fork)

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/justinwoo/spacchetti-react-basic-starter.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/justinwoo/spacchetti-react-basic-starter)

This is a fork of the LumiHQ/React-Basic-Starter repo from here: <https://github.com/lumihq/react-basic-starter>

This fork has differences from the original:

* Parcel to build the application and provide automatic hot reloading of React components
* Psc-Package or Spago for dependency management (Spago: <https://github.com/spacchetti/spago>)
* consumes the output modules from the PureScript compiler output directly (see src/index.html, src/index.js)

Video of hot reloading in action: <https://twitter.com/jusrin00/status/1060961458484326400>

This repo is representative of how a normal PureScript project would be set up.

See this article for how PureScript tooling works: <https://github.com/justinwoo/my-blog-posts/blob/master/posts/2018-03-20-setting-up-purescript-in-march-2018.md>
